# Empatica 
This App will have to run the backend and the client together, and concurrently. 
I have therefore installed concurrently 

## Installation

Starting from the root of the project on a terminal, type the following command
```npm install && npm install --prefix client```

## Execution

This command will run both the client and the server concurrently
```npm run dev```

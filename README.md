## Installation

Starting from the root of the project on a terminal, type the following command:
```npm install && npm install --prefix client```

## Execution
This App will have to run the backend and the client together (concurrently). This is achievable via a single command using the "concurrently" module. I made a shortcut for it in package.json, so all you'll have to run is: 

```npm run dev```
